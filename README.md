Vehicle Physics Controller

This project is a Unity-based Vehicle Physics Controller designed to simulate realistic vehicle movement, wheel interactions, and camera behavior. It allows for the creation of vehicles with multiple parts and wheels that dynamically interact with their environment. The system is highly customizable, supporting powered, free, and free-rolling wheels, as well as advanced camera controls.

Vehicle Controller
	•	Supports vehicles with multiple parts connected via joints. (Built in unity hinge joints)
	•	Realistic wheel physics:
	•	Powered, free, and free-rolling wheel states.
	•	Adjustable wheel properties like size, grip, suspension force, and max torque.
